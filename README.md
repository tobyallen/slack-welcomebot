This is a simple WelcomeBot implementation based on the Slack Ruby Onboarding Tutorial https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial go check it out for more information.

I've added a joke of the day and a few other things. Defintelity needs some more work to polish it up.

Also set it up so you can deploy it on Heroku after creating a valid .env file from the sample.
